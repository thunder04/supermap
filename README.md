# ✨ npm-template ✨
Basically what the `About` section says. Originally created for me but I guess you can use it too.
It uses [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) for compiling the TS code and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) to build the types.
The project gets automatically builded before packing or publishing or manually with the `npm prepack` script.
