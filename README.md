# ✨ npm-template ✨
This template repository allows you to create [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) packages in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) with ease. Originally created for me but I guess you can use it too.
It uses [esbuild](https://github.com/evanw/esbuild) for compiling the TS code and [TypeScript](https://github.com/microsoft/TypeScript) to generate the types.

The project gets automatically builded before `npm pack`ing or publishing or manually with the `npm prepack` script.
